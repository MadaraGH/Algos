Priority Queues

1. Each item in a queue is associated with a priority
2. Item with the biggest priority gets dequeued first
3. If more than one item has the same priority then the order in the queue is considered.
4. Can be implemented using arrays, linked lists and heaps - heaps are the best ways
5. Has getHighestPriority() and deleteHighestPriority()
5. Can be used for Dijkstra's shortest path algo and implementing spanning trees

for heaps - insert/delete O(log n), getHighestpriority O(1)

Operations					peek  		insert  	delete			
Linked List					O(1)		  O(n)		  O(1)			
Binary Heap					O(1)		  O(log n)	O(log n)
